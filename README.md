Project: Text Redaction

In this project, we created a system which detects "sensitive" items in the text. Once identified, the system will redact these sensitive items such as names, dates, addresses (city, state and country). After redacting the sensitive items, the program will save redacted file as a new file with the .txt extension in the current folder. We are using SpaCy module from Natural Language Processing with python.
